# UEFA Champions League Dashboard Project

## Problem Statement

The UEFA Champions League, one of the most prestigious football tournaments, is filled with thrilling matches and unforgettable moments. However, there is a need to analyze and understand the performance of various teams across different seasons. Despite the availability of match statistics, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis that could help in understanding the factors contributing to a team's success or failure.

The primary goal of this project is to create a dashboard that visually represents key performance indicators such as goals scored, possession, pass accuracy, and more.

The ultimate goal is to leverage these insights to predict future match outcomes, analyze team performance, and enhance the overall understanding of the game dynamics in the UEFA Champions League.
